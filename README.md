# React-Router-ProjectWebsite
I've built this project from scratch with React and react's library React-router-dom and with Tailwind CSS
I've learned how we can optimize our website by using react-router-dom library and avoid reloading our websites with the help of <LINK> tag.
Also, how we can catch parameters passed by the user in the search box and display the results accordingly.
